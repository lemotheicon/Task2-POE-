            <h1>OTHANDWENI CHILDREN'S HOME</h1>
            <P>Othandweni acts as a place of safety for the abused,abandoned or neglected children until suitable foster parent(s) are found(Givengain,2001). The children who are unable to find proper foster care families are given a place to stay at Othandweni(Givengain,2001).</p> 
            <p> Our babies receive regular check-ups at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital and feeding charts are used to monitor their health care. Moreover, with the help of the students from the Wits Occupational Therapy our children are assisted in provided stimulation and support(Givengain,2001).An Early Childhood Development(ECD) Centre provides the children with pre-school preparation on the premises</p>
            <p>Due to how detrimental prolonged institutionalisation is , it remains our top-priority to place babies with suitable families as soon as possible(Givengain,2001).</p>
            <h2>Children that are usually admitted into our care are:</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>Children whose parents are deceased:<br> 
                      -War,illness,natural disaster,natural deaths etc.</li>
                 <li>Children whose parents/guardians are unable to care for them:<br> 
                      -May not be financially stable or unemployed</li>
                 <li>Children whose parents/guardians are unwilling to care for them:<br> 
                      -Teen pregnancies,rape etc.</li>
                 <li>Children who have illnesses:<br> 
                      -HIV/AIDS , mental and physical disabled etc.</li>
             </ul>
            <h2>The Cottages</h2>
            <p>Supervised care in a family setting of 60 children and teens are offered Cottages(Givengain,2001).Five cottages are divided into age groups : the youngest children are 5 years old and the oldest are 18(Givengain,2001). A much needed revamp of these cottages was done recently and they were each renamed as Houses of <strong>Hope,Dignity,Respect,Trust and Honesty</strong> as a means of embracing a number of core values in a child's development(Givengain,2001).</p>
            <h2>The Nursery</h2>
            <p>30 babies at any given time are provided with care at the nursery(Gibengain,2001). They receive 24-hour supervision by qualified nurses and nursing assistants(Givengain,2001). Some of the neglected or abandoned babies suffer from a diverse range of ailments(Givengain,2001).These babies are nursed back to health while waiting for adoption,foster care or re-unification with their families(Givengain,2001). </p>
